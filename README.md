# __Peinture Évaluer__


https://bartekburnat7.github.io/Peinture_Evaluer_P1/


### __Target Audience__
Peinture Évaluer is a website made for collectors that are looking to evaluate their artwork so that they get an accurate price for their collection or a piece of artwork they are trying to sell.


### __Approach__
I decided to make the website a one-page layout to make it as basic and simple to use as possible, as most artwork collectors are older folk and aren't as tech-savvy as the younger population. This also creates a fast and enjoyable UI experience and increases the chances of the user coming back.


On the website, the user will be able to find out about the business's history and have the option to choose between the three services provided in the "Pricing" section. There is a large contact section where you will be able to type in your personal details, select what type of item is in question, and book a time to discuss the deal.

## __Features__


- __Navigation__
    - The navigation bar at the top of the page has two sections: the title, which brings you to the top of the page when clicked, and the menu with buttons that you can use to jump to each section of the website.
    - The navigation bar follows the user when they scroll, so it is easy to jump to each section from any part of the website.
    - New users that have never used the website can use the navigation bar to easily find the section of interest without scrolling through the page.

- __Heading__
    - The main hero area has a large image of a painting to signify that the website and company do indeed specialise in artwork and can catch the eye of new users looking for this specific service.
    - The container on top of the image tells the user what the company specialises in; the box also contains a button that links to the contact section so that a new user can quickly skip to the contact section and quickly get in touch with the business, increasing the chances of closing a deal with a client.

- __About Us__
    - The "About Us" section explains the business's history and what country and city they are based in. It informs the user about who runs the company and what qualities the company can bring to the client, which helps new users decide on which service to use.

- __Pricing__
    - The pricing section displays all the options that the company provides.
    - Each option has a list of features that come with the given service and displays the greyed-out features that are not included in that option. This gives a user a choice if they would rather not go for the most expensive option.
    - The business option has a purple gradient in the background to attract clients attention and make the top option stand out.

- __Contact Us__
    - The contact section is where the user can contact the company through the website to book a consultation or discuss
    what service the client should opt for.
    - The form validates if all fields are filled out or selected and checks if the right email format was used and all areas are filled in; otherwise, the form will inform the user what the error is and wont send the form.
    - Each field, when selected, will be highlighted; this is implemented so that users can clearly see what input area they are currently typing into and makes the process easier.

- __Footer__
    - The footer contains "Quick Links" if the user decides they would like to go back to any section of the page they have passed. This makes finding any part of the website effortless and creates an enjoyable user experience.
    - Extra contact information like a phone number or direct email address is also included, as some users may prefer to get in touch directly with the company staff instead of using the "Contact Us" section.

- ## __Testing__
    - I tested and made sure that the website is compatible on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge) and phone devices (Iphone) so that the user experience is seamless across the different platforms.
    - I made sure that all the links were working and linked to the right part of the website.
    - The website is responsive on tablets and phone devices, as I have tested the webpage using the built-in developer tools.

    - I made sure that the website is well structured, readable, and easy to follow. I achieved this by using simple design concepts, contrasting colours, and a clear font.

- ## __Deployment__
    - The website was deployed on Github Pages. Here are the steps I took:
        1. Go to the Github repository of your choice, then click on settings.
        2. Click the "Pages" tab from the list on the left.
        3. In the "Branch" Section, click on the dropdown and select main.
        4. Hit save, and the website will be deployed to the GitHub pages.


## __Credits__


- I used stack overflow to find a way to display a default value in the "input select" inside the form so that it shows "Choose Here": https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3518002/how-can-i-set-the-default-value-for-an-html-select-element.


### __Content__


- I used a website named https://cssgradient.io/ to create the gradient in CSS for my footer and pricing page.
